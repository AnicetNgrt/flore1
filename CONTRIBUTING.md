# ðŸ’¡ Contributing to flore1 
**Thanks a lot for contributing to flore1 ! â•°(\*Â°â–½Â°\* )â•¯** 

Flore1 is still a small scale project made almost entirely by I (the writer). 
I am a solo dev who is not very used to collaborative work on github.
I aim to learn from thoses who want to contribute to this project. So please consider the fact that there is no fancy well redacted guidelines now.

# ðŸ“œ Guidelines:
### ðŸ§  General state of mind:
 - A faster/more optimised version will always be priviligiated.
 - Improvements and bugfixes must be demonstrated and explained clearly in your pull requests.
 - Improving on syntax and code style is welcomed if it leads to similar or better performances.
 - Be patient, contribution shall always be rewarded in some way.

### ðŸ“® Your pull request should include:

 - The list of improvements and bugfixes
 - A clear explanation of each new or modified algorithm
 - The test files you used to compare performance
 - The test files for the new fonctionnalities
 
 ### ðŸ“– Helping with the documentation and the tutorials:
 I don't expect anyone to do this for me, but if still you do, please send me your piece of documentation or your tutorial for reviewing in a .md file on my email: []-anicet.nougaret@zohomail.com
